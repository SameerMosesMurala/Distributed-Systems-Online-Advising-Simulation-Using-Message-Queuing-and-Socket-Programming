# Distributed-Systems-Online-Advising-Simulation-Using-Message-Queuing-and-Socket-Programming

simulate an online advising system which is similar to what you might use to register for classes. Students request 
clearance for a course from the advisor. At some other time, the advisor approves or disapproves the request, and then 
the student is notified of the advisorâ€™s decision.
Four processes are required to simulate this: a Student Process, an Advisor Process, a Notification Process, and a Message 
Queuing Server (MQS). The Student Process, Advisor Process, and Notification Process communicate through the Message Queuing Server 
(message-oriented middleware). Communication from these processes to the Message Queuing Server utilizes both push and pull protocols.
